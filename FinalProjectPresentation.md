## Inspiration

I was inspired to create this application from Pacman. As a kid I enjoyed how simple yet entertaining the game was so I decided to make something similar but to where I could control every part of the design myself.

# Concept Description
The purpose of this application will be for the user to go through a maze-like structure while avoiding be caught by multiple enemies within the maze as well.

## Lessons Learned



# What did you do right?
The only thing I did right was the desgin and the registration page

# What did you do wrong?
Throughout the project I had to redo it twice. I messed up the Identity and couldn't fix it and I sepnt too much time on the login.

# Where were you lucky? 
I was lucky with the classmates that I had because I had help when I got stuck

# What would you change what do you know now that you wish you knew "then"?
That the game should have been my main focus from the beginning insteaad of the registration page and and login page
