I was inspired to create this application from Pacman. As a kid I enjoyed how simple yet entertaining the game was so I decided to make something similar but to where I could control every part of the design myself.

                                                                    Concept Description
The purpose of this application will be for the user to go through a maze-like structure while avoiding be caught by multiple enemies within the maze as well.


                                                                          Wireframe
